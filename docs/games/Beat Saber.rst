Beat Saber
==========

Tools and Version
-----------------

`Beat Saber Manager <https://github.com/Zagrios/bs-manager>`_ is used to both control the version install of Beat Saber but also manage 90% of the mods

I am playing on v1.29.1 for the best mod compatability for 3D models. Most of the mods are available in 1.31.1, with the exception for model mods

Chat Commands
-------------

**!bsr X**
  Request a song for me to play. Best used when going to `Beat Saver <https://beatsaver.com/>`_ and copying the command / ID from there

  .. code-block:: none

    !bsr 12abf

**!bsrhelp**
  A quick rundown in chat on how to use the !bsr command with a link to `Beat Saver <https://beatsaver.com/>`_

  .. code-block:: none

    !bsrhelp

**!link**
