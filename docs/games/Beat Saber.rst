Beat Saber
==========

Tools and Version
-----------------

I am using `Beat Saber Manager <https://github.com/Zagrios/bs-manager>`_ to manage both the mods and the installation of Beat Saber as it can install specific versions which have better mod support. This also helps prevent issues when an update is released and breaks some mods. 

I am running v1.29.1 for the best mod support and use of custom assets like custom sabers

Chat Commands
-------------

**!bsr X**
  Request a song for me to play. Best used when going to `Beat Saver <https://beatsaver.com/>`_ and copying the command / ID from there

  .. code-block:: none

    !bsr 12abf

**!bsrhelp**
  A quick rundown in chat on how to use the !bsr command with a link to `Beat Saver <https://beatsaver.com/>`_

**!link**
  Get the link to the current / most recent song played

**!oops**
  Take back the last song you added to the queue
