Channel Points
==============

What do they do?
----------------

Using channel points you can do the typical things like "Hydrate" and what not, but there are other channel points that affect the stream directly.

Any Channel Points used in stream will get you half as many points spent in PhatCoin

How do Channel Rewards affect the stream?
-----------------------------------------

Using the tool Lioranboard_ I can create complex sequences of commands that can be activated using Channel Points
