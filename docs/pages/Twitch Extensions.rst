Chrome Twitch Extensions
========================

There are 2 extensions for Chrome that I would recommend getting for Chrome :)

BetterTTV_
	Adds some animated emotes to the chat and some extra things that many channels use!

`Twitch Chat Pronouns`__
	Adds the ability to add your prefered pronouns to the front of your name in the chat. `Visit their website <https://pronouns.alejo.io/>`_ to set your preferred pronouns!
