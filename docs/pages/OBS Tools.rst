OBS Setup
=========

A list of the tools and plugins that are used to do all the stuff the stream does. This does require OBS Studio, OBS.Live and SLOBS are not compatible with most of the tools used.

Tools
-----

SAMMI_
	Used to do scene changes and effects that happen on stream. This also enabled the Channel Point interactions to happen automatically

Plugins
-------

`Advanced Scene Switcher`__
	As the name states, will automatically change scene based on different conditions

__ ASS_

`Closed Captioning via Google Speech Recognition`__
	Provides live Closed Captions to the stream. They are added using Twitches built in CC so it is not forced in the stream and does not require a Twitch Extension

`DroidCam OBS`__
	Adds the ability to use mobile phones as cameras

__ Cam__


`Freeze Filter`__
	Adds the ability to live freeze a source for different effects

__ FF_

`Move Transition`__
	Adds the ability to both move sources but also change values for another filter for gradual changes

__ MT_

`OBS-NDI`__
	Adds the ability to share output and preview over the network to be captured by Skye in her OBS

__ NDI_

`Replay Source`__
	Adds the ability to replay a specific source instead of the whole scene for clean replays

__ RS_

`StreamFX`__
	Adds many filters to sources to allow many effects

__ SFX_

`Waveform`__
	Adds a audio wave form to the stream when we speak as a cool feature
