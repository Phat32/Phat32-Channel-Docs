OBS Setup
=========

A list of the tools and plugins that are used to do all the stuff the stream does. This does require OBS Studio, OBS.Live and SLOBS are not compatible with most of the tools used.

Tools
-----

Lioranboard_
	Used to do scene changes and effects that happen on stream. This also enabled the Channel Point interactions to happen automatically

Plugins
-------

`Advanced Scene Switcher`__
	As the name states, will automatically change scene based on different conditions

__ ASS_

`Closed Captioning via Google Speech Recognition`__
	Provides live Closed Captions to the stream. They are added using Twitches built in CC so it is not forced in the stream and does not require a Twitch Extension

__ CC_

`Freeze Filter`__
	Adds the ability to live freeze a source for different effects

__ FF_

`Move Transition`__
	Adds the ability to both move sources but also change values for another filter for gradual changes

__ MT_

`OBS Websockets`__
	Adds Websockets that other tools can link into. Required for Liboardboard to function

__ OW_

`Replay Source`__
	Adds the ability to replay a specific source instead of the whole scene for clean replays

__ RS_

`StreamFX`__
	Adds many filters to sources to allow many effects

__ SFX_
