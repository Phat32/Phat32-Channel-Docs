Chrome Extensions
=================

There are 2 extensions for Chrome that I would recommend getting for youself. These are for chrome but they will work on others too, just find them on their extension platforms

`BetterTTV <https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/betterttv/ajopnjidmegmdimjlfnijceegpefgped?hl=en>`_
	Adds some animated emotes to the chat and some extra things that many channels use!

`Twitch Chat Pronouns <https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/twitch-chat-pronouns/agnfbjmjkdncblnkpkgoefbpogemfcii>`_
	Adds the ability to add your prefered pronouns to the front of your name in the chat. `Visit their website <https://pronouns.alejo.io/>`_ to set your preferred pronouns!
