What is a Phat32?
=================

Phat32 is me, I am him. Call me Phat32, Phat, or by just Tom if you like.

I see. Tell me more
-------------------

I am Canadian out in BC, a Husband, a Software Developer, and a Partnered streamer on Twitch.  I have a particular love for `Star Citizen <https://phat32.tv/starcitizen>`_ which my Wife has also gotten into *(squeee)* but am what you would call a Variety Streamer. I like to change it up and try new and indie games.

If you have any questions, feel free to join the `Discord <https://phat32.tv/discord>`_, follow me on `Twitter <https://phat32.tv/twitter>`_ (you will not catch me calling it anything else) or `Instagram <https://phat32.tv/instagram>`_. Join us live for the streams happening over on `Twitch <https://twitch.tv/phat32>`_

Seriously, Why All of This?
---------------------------

As with most Streamers, I have added many different ways for the viewers to intereact more directly with the stream while it is happening. Part of that is a bunch of commands that are changed here and there or new ones added for the lulz.

Just wanted a nice easy place where that can all be seen
