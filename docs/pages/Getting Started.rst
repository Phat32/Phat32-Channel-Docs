Who is Phat32?
==============

Hi! I am Phat32, or by just Tom. Feel free to call me Phat32, Phat or Tom! Any of them is totally fine by me!

I am Canadian out in BC, a Husband, a Software Developer, and a Partnered streamer on Twitch. During the day I work a day job and write code, but in the evening or days off I will be streaming! I have a particular love for `Star Citizen`__ which my Wife has also gotten into *(squeee)* but am what you would call a Variety Streamer. I like to change it up and try new and indie games.

If you have any questions, feel free to join the Discord_, follow me on Twitter_ or Instagram_, or join the streams happening over on Twitch_

Seriously, Why All of This?
===========================

As with most Streamers, I have added many different ways for the viewers to intereact more directly with the stream while it is happening. Part of that is a bunch of commands that are changed here and there or new ones added for the lulz.

Just wanted a nice easy place where that can all be seen
